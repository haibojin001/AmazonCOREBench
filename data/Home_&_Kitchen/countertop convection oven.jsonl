While your meal cooks, FlavorSeal technology prevents flavor crossover between ovens. The Smart Cook System precisely monitors temperatures with the leave-in thermometer, so you don't have to. Two oven cavities in one eliminate back-to-back cooking for 65% faster meal-making than your traditional oven so you can put your wall oven out of business. Plus, this countertop dual oven features 12 cooking functions for the ultimate versatility.", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/B0BRL9F8HV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Ninja-DCT451-Thermometer-FlavorSeal-Convection/dp/B0BRL9F8HV"}
