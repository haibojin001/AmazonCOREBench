Keep your septic system in optimal condition with Green Pig\u2019s reliable septic tank treatment capabilities, which promote a healthy and fresh environment. From the Manufacturer Why use GreenPig Septic Tank Treatment. Drainage failure is due to the gradual buildup of accumulated sludge. Undigested raw sewage and grime can build up throughout your entire septic system including the tank, lines, cesspit, sand mound, leach field and drain field when the system is untreated or poorly maintained. Due to the use of household cleaners and other common chemicals septic tank systems that have not been properly treated can have a difficult time digesting and degrading the raw septic sewage that enters the tank because of a decrease in beneficial septic tank bacteria. GreenPig septic tank treatment is populated with one billion septic tank bacteria that quickly multiply to absorb and digest sludge, grease, paper and solid waste which may clog your septic, cesspit, leach field , drain field or and mound systems. By packaging our product as a year supply, GreenPig is able to offer the greatest value, by far. In addition, our product treats 500, 1000, and 1500-Gallon tanks so there is no need to guess what size tank you have. Simply flush one solupak down the toilet once every three months, the packet will dissolve in your septic system. No mess, no fuss, no measuring, SIMPLE. GreenPig is 7 stands of bacteria, over a billion per gram. The bacteria found in GreenPig have been specifically chosen to break down septic tank waste. A colony of bacteria already exist in your septic system, GreenPig is adding more bacteria to break down waste to help avoid future problems such as clogged leach fields, pooling of water in the yard, and obnoxious odors. GreenPig is a concentrate and as a company, we never felt the need to add \u201cfillers\u201d to make our package look bigger to make customers feel like they are getting more bacteria.
