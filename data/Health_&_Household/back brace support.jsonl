Features rubber track webbing to help keep support in position. SIZING To choose your size, use flexible measuring tape and find the circumference around your body at your belly button. The support should fit snugly around your hips with the front of the support two-fingers width below your navel. An easy-to-use hook & loop closure keeps the belt securely fastened while in use and can be worn over or underneath clothing. Adjust the suspenders straps to fit securely on your shoulders without causing tension. Turn it into a back support belt by simply detaching the shoulder straps from the belt. HOW IT WORKS Ergodyne ProFlex Back Supports provide lower back support and abdominal support for lifting heavy objects. Tightening the back support belt enhances the body\u2019s intra-abdominal pressure and moves the stress away from the spine. When the back support is on correctly, the worker will have additional support for lifting and is more likely to use proper posture. When not lifting, be sure to loosen the belt. Great for airport luggage handlers, warehouse/distribution employees, material handling, construction crews, maintenance, assembly/fabrication, landscaping/grounds and jobs that require heavy lifting. We cannot guarantee that wearing a back brace will prevent workplace injury or be a cure for lower back pain, but when used properly these supports will provide extra lumbar support, promote proper lifting techniques and help you through a work day of bending, twisting, and schlepping. Rest assured, we got your back From the Manufacturer After 25 years and at least 30 positive epidemiological studies, we could fill a front-end loader with research that proves back support effectiveness. Bottom line is, smart companies big and small have learned the value of lock and load back support. Because when it comes to providing crucial truncal support and limiting the range of motion associated with most back injuries, these back supporting bad boys are king of the hill. Now, workers can fearlessly pick up the package, the slack and the pace.
