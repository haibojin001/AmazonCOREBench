There are no heavily perfumed chemical smells or slimy chemical residues left behind on your skin. Right away you'll smell and feel a difference. Your clothes will actually feel and smell clothesline fresh--nice and soft. HUGE Savings. A box of chemical dryer sheets currently costs five dollars and up. Liquid fabric softeners and dryer sheets are petrochemical (crude oil) based, and cost even more at $8 to $10 per bottle. Costs continue to rise due to escalating chemical, manufacturing and transportation costs. Many households use several bottles or boxes of fabric softener a month. Even though fabric softeners may seem like a small expense, they are purchased so often that many households spend a small fortune on them annually. It is just another household expense that you do not need, and one you can eliminate with the Dryer System. A reduction of the amount of harsh chemicals on your clothing and the long drying times causes less wear and tear on your expensive clothes and on the dryer. Using the Dryer System may lengthen the life of your costly wardrobe and dryer, and keep more money in your pocket. Also much better and safer than using expensive and temporary wool dryer balls. Wool dryer balls: 1. Last a short period of time and then get thrown out 2. Are much more expensive than the Dryer System 3. Dont have the massaging nodes that are actually what softens your clothing. 4. Can come apart and potential damage/jam your washer and become a fire hazard. 5. Can actually exacerbate wool and lanolin allergies. The Dryer System has none of these major drawbacks, works better, lasts MUCH longer and costs less.
