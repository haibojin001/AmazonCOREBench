What is the H2prO\u2122 Flat Mop System and how is it different? H2prO\u2122 is a flat mop system with a dual-tank bucket and built-in water jets that spray clean water directly onto the mop pad.

It is ideal for sealed hardwood, tile, laminate, vinyl, and even vertical surfaces like baseboards and walls. Can I use cleaning solution in the water tank? Use water only or add up to 2 teaspoons of floor cleaner. Do not use bleach or PACS, as they are not designed for the H2prO\u2122 system. How do I control the amount of water on the pad? The rinse chamber\u2019s spring-loaded lever lets you control how much water is sprayed onto the pad. Does it clean with just water? Yes. The microfiber removes over 99% of E. coli and Staph. aureus from pre-finished hardwood flooring and ceramic tile using tap water, as tested at an independent accredited lab. How tall is the handle? The adjustable handle extends up to 56 inches for comfortable cleaning. How often should I replace the mop pad? Replace the mop pad when it becomes worn, and keep extras on hand so you are always prepared. Is there a warranty? Yes. H2prO\u2122 is warranted against defective materials or workmanship.
