The power line rate is mainly decided by the quality of power line environment it\u2019s operating in. When your power line rate is low, you may try the steps below to improve the quality of service. Step 1: Please check whether your powerline adapters are plugged directly into a wall outlet. If not, please move the adapters to an outlet on the wall. Step 2: Please check if there are electrical devices, which have a motor inside them, around the powerline adapters. Such equipment can be air-conditioners, washing-machines, electric-fans etc.. Please move such equipment to another location if possible, or move powerline adapters away from such equipment. You may also buy a surge protector and plug such equipments to its outlets to avoid any interference they may cause. Step 3: Please check if there are AC power adapters, such as those used for mobile phones, laptops or something else around the adapters. If the quality of AC power adapter is not good, it may cause noise on the power line circuit. Please move it to another place away from the powerline adapters. Step 4: Please check if the distance between the adapters is too long. In theory, the maximum distance is 300 meters. However, with interference and line quality, it will be hard to reach the full 300 meters.", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/B084CZMYNM/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Powerline-Ethernet-Adapter-Extender-TP-Link/dp/B084CZMYNM"}

Actual data speeds vary and may be limited by the product\u2019s Ethernet port and other network conditions such as data traffic, electrical noise, and wiring issues. For better performance, powerline devices should be deployed on the same electrical circuit and rated for the same HomePlug standard. A minimum of two powerline devices are required to establish a powerline connection. If you are uncertain about your network conditions, you should consult an IT professional to assist in selecting a networking product. About power saving, actual power saved varies based on network conditions and environmental factors.", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/B00AWRUICG/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-AV600-Powerline-Ethernet-Adapter/dp/B00AWRUICG"}
