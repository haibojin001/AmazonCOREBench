The Edge TPU is a small ASIC designed by Google that provides high performance ML inferencing with low power requirements: it's capable of performing 4 trillion operations (tera-operations) per second (TOPS), using 0.5 watts for each TOPS (2 TOPS per watt). For example, it can execute state-of-the-art mobile vision models such as MobileNet v2 at almost 400 FPS, in a power efficient manner. This on-device processing reduces latency, increases data privacy, and removes the need for constant high-bandwidth connectivity. The M.2 Accelerator is a dual-key M.2 card (either A+E or B+M keys), designed to fit any compatible M.2 slot. This form-factor enables easy integration into ARM and x86 platforms so you can add local ML acceleration to products such as embedded platforms, mini-PCs, and industrial gateways. AI-enabled NVR system If you are planning to use Coral M.2 B+M Accelerator for Home Assistant of home automation applications, we recommend Odyssey Blue, an Intel Celeron J4125 powered X86 Windows/Linux mini PC, you can set them together with ip cameras for a local AI processed NVR system. Frigate is a completely open source and local NVR designed for Home Assistant with AI-powered object detection. It uses OpenCV and Tensorflow to perform real-time object detection locally for IP cameras. It brings a rich set of features including video recording, re-streaming, motion detection, and supports multiprocessing. The Coral M.2 Accelerator B+M key integrates an Edge TPU into existing computer systems using an M.2 B-key or M-key interface. This module is particularly well-suited for mobile and embedded systems that can benefit from accelerated machine learning. Key Features Performance: The Edge TPU coprocessor is capable of performing 4 trillion operations per second (4 TOPS) with a power consumption of just 2 watts. Modern Mobile Vision models, such as MobileNet v2, can be efficiently run at nearly 400 FPS. Compatibility: Supported on Debian Linux-based systems and Windows 10. Systems without an M.2 slot can be upgraded using the Coral USB Accelerator.
