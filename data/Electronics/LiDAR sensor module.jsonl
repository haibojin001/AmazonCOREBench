It uses uart to output data and is compatible with mainstream open source flight controllers such as Ardupilot, PX4, and INAV . (You can freely modify the communication protocol between the sensor and the flight controller using the USB to UART TTL Module making it compatible with different flight controllers.). It can be used directly after simple configuration without complicated development process. MTF-01 features an integrated PMW3901 optical flow sensor and a high-performance TOF sensor , which can be used normally in outdoor sunlight environments. About Protocols INAV Version (MSP Protocol) Ardupilot Version PX4 Version If you need to change the communication protocol yourself or make additional settings to the sensor (such as changing the installation direction of the sensor on the drone), you will need a USB to TTL module. If you do not have this module, you can purchase it through the following link. This module is already connected to the MTF01 dedicated cable and can be directly connected to the sensor. Link If you are using Ardupilot firmware, you do not need an additional USB to TTL module to set up the MTF01 sensor.
