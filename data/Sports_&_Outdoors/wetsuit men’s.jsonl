{"name": "Hevto Men Wetsuits 3/2mm Neoprene Wet Suit Back Front Zip in Cold Water for Surfing Swimming Diving", "price": "$69.99", "short_description": ["Why - Wetsuits can give you extra warmth in cold water. The working principle of wetsuits is that a thin layer of water will be left on the body when water enters the clothes, then this layer of water will generate heat from friction as the body moves, which protects the body from the cold.", "What - Hevto training wetsuits are designed for adult men surfing/diving beginners and amateurs. The royal blue sleeves and side seams create a striking color clash with the black. You may feel constricted the first time wear it, but it\u2019s necessary to provide you with warmth and buoyancy. Once you get used to it, you'll find that the wetsuit not only keeps you warm in the cold water but also helps you float more easily, allowing you to master your swimming and diving skills more quickly.", "Where- Hevto wetsuits are made of 3/2mm neoprene and nylon stretch fabric for softness and comfort. Stretchy fabrics give the wetsuit flexibility and fit body shape perfectly, which helps reduce the resistance to water. It is suitable for all kinds of water sports, such as diving, swimming, surfing, snorkeling, paddleboarding, kayaking, jet ski, etc.", "How - No need to worry about the back zipper will bring trouble, we not only have a sturdy zipper track but also set a lengthened nylon belt. Zip it up quickly requires only two steps - grab the bottom of the zipper track and then pull it up with the other hand. You can instantly enjoy the smooth zipping process with the correct operation.", "Who - The Hevto wetsuit is not just a piece of gear but a companion that embodies resilience, determination, and passion to explore the unknown waters. Wearing a Hevto wetsuit connects you to a community of water lovers who share the same sense of adventure and respect for the ocean."], "product_description": null, "product_details": ["Item Package Dimensions L x W x H \u200e12.13 x 10.55 x 4.92 inches", "Package Weight \u200e0.95 Kilograms", "Brand Name \u200eHevto", "Color \u200eM1-3/2mm-Back Zip-Blue", "Material \u200eNeoprene, Nylon", "Suggested Users \u200emens", "Manufacturer \u200eHevto Wetsuits", "Size \u200eX-Small", "Sport Type \u200eKayaking, Paddle Boarding, Scuba Diving, Surfing, Swimming", "ASIN B0CNCFX9M6", "Customer Reviews 4.5 4.5 out of 5 stars (3,997)", "Best Sellers Rank #5,387 in Sports & Outdoors ( See Top 100 in Sports & Outdoors ) #3 in Full Wetsuits", "Date First Available November 15, 2023"], "images": "{\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WeBp2QmZL._AC_SY550_.jpg\":[550,397],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WeBp2QmZL._AC_SY679_.jpg\":[679,490],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WeBp2QmZL._AC_SY450_.jpg\":[450,325],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WeBp2QmZL._AC_SY879_.jpg\":[879,635],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WeBp2QmZL._AC_SY606_.jpg\":[606,438],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WeBp2QmZL._AC_SY355_.jpg\":[355,256],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51WeBp2QmZL._AC_SY741_.jpg\":[741,535]}", "rating": "4.5 out of 5 stars", "number_of_reviews": "(3,997)", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/B0C1P5JJBX/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Hevto-Wetsuits-Neoprene-Snorkeling-M06-Black/dp/B0C1P5JJBX"}
