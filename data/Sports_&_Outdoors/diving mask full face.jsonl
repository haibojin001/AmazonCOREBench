The low profile visor ensures great visibility. The ABV valve helps preserve your air when on the surface.", "Diving becomes effortless especially in cold water. The Guardian helps keep your face warm and being able to breathe out your nose helps keep you from getting a dry throat, which is common for divers who have long duration dives.", "Women and men both found the mask to be extremely comfortable. In some cases, women who could not dive any other full face mask were able to easily dive the Guardian", "The mask bag was specifically designed for a full face mask. The design actually helps maintain the mask. The bag has large drain holes located on the bottom and a vent screen on the top. This helps in the drying process after diving.", "The Guardian was designed with a double seal, allowing for the comfort of both small and large faces."], "product_description": ["With over 60 years of diving experience, and having sold almost every type of Full Face Mask on the market, it was easy to see there was a need for something better. As a result OTS designed the Guardian Full Face Mask. A common problem with most FFM on the market today is the seal. The lack of a good seal causes the diver to use air quicker and can interfere with the divers ability to hear if using underwater communications. With that in mind, the GFFM was designed around a double seal allowing for the comfort of both small and large faces. Equalizing is a challenge for all full face masks one size does not fit all. In order to ensure everyone can equalize, we have put together an Equalizing Kit, which comes with every Guardian full face mask. The kit consists of two bases. One is a standard size without any holes. It can be adjusted up or down to fit as necessary. The other base has two holes, which allow for different size pads that can be added. In the event the standard base does not work for you, one of the pads and the other base should fit the bill. The Guardians low profile allows superb visibility and its easily removable 2nd stage regulator works great for storage and easy maintenance. The Ambient Breathing Valve allows the user to breathe ambient air at the surface, conserving your tank air. It is simple to use and its low profile keeps it out of the way. Adjustable head straps with robust hardware make this mask what it is, simply the best. We have also included a full face mask bag. The mask bag was designed to help keep your mask in the right drying position, keeping water from pooling in your 2nd stage regulator. It also has vents to keep good ventilation helping to stop mildew and drain holes to let water drain away from the mask. Lots of storage pockets as well. The bag has a carrying handle as well as a shoulder strap.
