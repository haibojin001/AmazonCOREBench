Time activated switches (also known as timers) operate at preset time intervals during a daily or weekly period and can be either mechanical or electronic. Mechanical timers feature a dial with multiple pins to set the on/off time intervals. Electronic timers feature an LCD display and pushbuttons to set the time intervals. Light activated switches (also known as optical or photo) operate when ambient light levels reach preset values, generally measured in foot candles. Motion-activated switches (also known as motion sensors) operate when an electronic field of a preset range is interrupted. These switches can include energy saving logic that uses combinations of time, light, and motion to operate and can include one or more device outlets or circuit contacts. Automatic switches are used to control indoor lights, outdoor lights, appliances, and small equipment motors.
