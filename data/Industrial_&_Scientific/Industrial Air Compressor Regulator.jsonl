If the load flow decreases, then the regulator flow must decrease also. If the load flow increases, then the regulator flow must increase in order to keep the controlled pressure from decreasing due to a shortage of gas in the pressure system. High pressure gas from the supply enters into the regulator through the inlet valve. The gas then enters the body of the regulator, which is controlled by the needle valve. The pressure rises, which pushes the diaphragm, closing the inlet valve to which it is attached, and preventing any more gas from entering the regulator. The outlet side is fitted with a pressure gauge. As gas is drawn from the outlet side, the pressure inside the regulator body falls. The diaphragm is pushed back by the spring and the valve opens, letting more gas in from the supply until equilibrium is reached between the outlet pressure and the spring. The outlet pressure therefore depends on the spring force, which can be adjusted by means of an adjustment knob."], "product_details": ["Brand \u200eTHB", "Voltage \u200e12 Volts", "Recommended Uses For Product \u200eversatile air compressor applications requiring pressure regulation", "Power Source \u200eCorded Electric", "Special Feature \u200eHeavy Duty", "Included Components \u200eGAUGE, WALL BRACKET", "Item Weight \u200e0.78 Kilograms", "Color \u200eSilver", "Material \u200eAluminum", "Style \u200e3/4\" NPT, 140 CFM", "Air Flow Capacity \u200e140 Cubic Feet Per Minute", "Model Name \u200eR706N", "Maximum Operating Pressure \u200e300 Pound per Square Inch", "Manufacturer \u200eT-H-B CO EDGE INDUSTRIAL", "UPC \u200e687927981423", "Part Number \u200eR706N", "Item Weight \u200e1.71 pounds", "Package Dimensions \u200e8.74 x 4.69 x 3.03 inches", "Item model number \u200eR706N", "Is Discontinued By Manufacturer \u200eNo", "Item Package Quantity \u200e1", "Special Features \u200eHeavy Duty", "Usage \u200eCOMPRESSED AIR", "Batteries Included? \u200eNo", "Batteries Required? \u200eNo", "ASIN B06XMXCN6X", "Customer Reviews 4.5 4.5 out of 5 stars (513)", "Best Sellers Rank #32,915 in Tools & Home Improvement ( See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement ) #61 in Air-Compressor Accessories", "Date First Available April 21, 2009"], "images": "{\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7150ZlY1D+L._AC_SX425_.jpg\":[494,425],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7150ZlY1D+L._AC_SX466_.jpg\":[541,466],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7150ZlY1D+L._AC_SY355_.jpg\":[355,306],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7150ZlY1D+L._AC_SX569_.jpg\":[661,569],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7150ZlY1D+L._AC_SY450_.jpg\":[450,387],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7150ZlY1D+L._AC_SX679_.jpg\":[789,679],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7150ZlY1D+L._AC_SX522_.jpg\":[606,522]}", "rating": "4.5 out of 5 stars", "number_of_reviews": "(513)", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/B06XMXCN6X/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/COMPRESSED-PRESSURE-REGULATOR-ADJUSTABLE-BRACKET/dp/B06XMXCN6X"}
