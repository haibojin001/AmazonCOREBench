The compressor can be used for refrigeration in a high temperature environment of 45\u2103. Precautions\uff1a 1. This product is industrial cooling and air-conditioning equipment, not a houseware. 2. This product is a local cooling air-conditioning equipment. The cooling and heat dissipation are on the same machine, which is different from the traditional household split air conditioner. 3. The design and use environment of this product is 18-45\u2103. If the temperature is lower than or higher than this temperature zone, the equipment will not operate normally, not the product itself is malfunctioning. 4. The noise of this product is 60-70 decibels, which is not suitable for occasions that require noise (such as bedrooms, meeting rooms, offices, libraries, etc.). 5. Please clean the filter regularly. If dust and dirt accumulate on the filter, it will affect the air intake, easily cause frost on the heat exchanger, affect the cooling effect, and cause the machine to malfunction. NOTE!: This machine cannot cool the whole space (if the whole space needs to be cooled down, it is necessary to install pvc hose or aluminum foil single tube at the hot air outlet to discharge the hot air outside,this machine needs to choose a 20cm size hose). NOTE\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01 When cleaning the surface of the machine, do not use chemicals such as thinner, volatile oil, etc., otherwise it will affect the appearance of the machine."], "product_details": ["Brand Name \u200eBanfluxion", "Item Weight \u200e143.3 pounds", "Product Dimensions \u200e16.9 x 15.7 x 45 inches", "Part Number \u200eCB-023494", "Voltage \u200e110 Volts", "Wattage \u200e1000 watts", "ASIN B0FHJR3L5M", "Best Sellers Rank #2,829,913 in Home & Kitchen ( See Top 100 in Home & Kitchen ) #2,667 in Portable Air Conditioners", "Date First Available July 15, 2025"], "images": "{\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mEbroT7BL._AC_SX342_.jpg\":[342,342],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mEbroT7BL._AC_SX466_.jpg\":[466,466],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mEbroT7BL._AC_SX385_.jpg\":[385,385],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mEbroT7BL._AC_SX569_.jpg\":[569,569],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mEbroT7BL._AC_SX522_.jpg\":[522,522],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mEbroT7BL._AC_SX425_.jpg\":[425,425],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mEbroT7BL._AC_SX679_.jpg\":[679,679]}", "rating": "Previous set of slides", "number_of_reviews": null, "link_to_all_reviews": null, "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Banfluxion-Industrial-Conditioner-350-450m%C2%B3-Commercial/dp/B0FHJR3L5M"}
