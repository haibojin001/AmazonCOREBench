The WEN 4500-Watt Inverter Generator provides clean energy, free of voltage spikes and drops, without all the noise of a regular generator. Produce up to 4500 surge watts and 3600 rated watts of power. Our 181cc engine operates at a modest 62 decibels at quarter load. This limits its invasiveness while camping, hunting, tailgating, and restoring backup power. The WEN 4500W Inverter Generator is also equipped with fuel shutoff. This feature turns off the flow of fuel, allowing for the generator to use up the remaining fuel from the carburetor before automatically shutting down. This helps fight the build-up and blockages caused by stagnant fuel inside of the carburetor, minimizing maintenance while prolonging the unit\u2019s lifespan. Designed to mirror a pure sine wave, this generator limits total harmonic distortion to under 0.3 percent at no load and under 1.2 percent at full load, making it safe to run laptops, cellphones, monitors, tablets and other sensitive electronics. The lightweight 53-pound design makes for easy portability, while the ultra-efficient 1.27-gallon tank provides up to 5.6 hours of half-load run time. The fully-packed panel comes equipped with two three-prong 120V NEMA 5-20R receptacles, one 12V DC receptacle, one 120V TT-30R RV receptacle, an intelligent data meter, and two 5V USB ports. Maximize fuel economy by engaging the eco-mode button. This allows the generator's engine to automatically adjust its fuel consumption as items are plugged into and unplugged from the panel, preventing the unnecessary usage of gasoline. Need more energy? Easily link up any two 120V WEN inverter generators using a WEN 120V Parallel Connection Kit (sold separately) in order to share wattage amongst multiple units. Low-oil and low-fuel automatic shutdown combine with the built-in overload protection and indicator lights to safeguard both your generator and your electronics from damage. And because this is a WEN product, your inverter generator comes backed by a 3-year limited warranty, a nationwide network of skilled service technicians, and a friendly customer helpline. Remember when your generator powered your electronics safely and quietly?
