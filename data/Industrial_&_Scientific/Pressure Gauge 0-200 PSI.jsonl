The brass wetted parts are for measuring non-corrosive liquid and gas pressure. The black-painted steel case is Ingress Protection certified IP52 for protection against dust or liquids. The circular dial comes in 1.5\" (40 mm), 2\" (50 mm), 2.5\" (63 mm), and 4\" (100 mm) diameters. The dial has an aluminum black pointer. The lens for the 1.5\", 2\", and 2.5\"diameter dials is polycarbonate for high impact resistance. The lens for the 4\" diameter dial is glass for strength and clarity. The gauge measures pressure with a dual scale of either psi/kPa or Hg. vacuum/kPa. The gauge is accurate to + or - 3/2/3% over the entire range of the gauge, American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) B40.100 Grade B accuracy class. The male connection is mounted on the bottom or center back of the gauge and has either a 1/4\" NPT (National Pipe Thread) or 1/2\" NPT rate. The bourdon tube is phosphor bronze, the movement is brass, and the welding is silver alloy. The over-pressure limit is 25% of full scale value. The working pressure is a maximum of 75% of full scale value. The operating temperature is -40 to 150 degrees F (-40 to 65 degrees C). This pressure gauge is suitable for plumbing, heating, air conditioning, pneumatic, hydraulic, water tanks, and air compressors. Pressure gauges are instruments used to measure the pressure of a gas or liquid inside a vessel and, often, to help ensure the optimal amount of pressure for a given application. Pressure gauges can range from everyday instruments, such as those used to measure the air pressure in a car or bicycle tire, to highly accurate gauges used in mechanical and industrial processing. Most often, pressure gauges measure pressure relative to another reference. For instance, gauge pressure measures pressure relative to ambient air. An example of a pressure gauge measuring relative to ambient air is a tire pressure gauge or a blood pressure gauge. Differential pressure is the difference in pressure between two points, such as when measuring liquid flow along various points in a pipeline. An absolute pressure gauge measures pressure relative to a perfect vacuum, such as an atmospheric or barometric pressure gauge. All types of pressure gauges include either a male or a female mount to connect to the vessel where pressure is being measured, and display results on a dial with varying increments of measure across a given range.
