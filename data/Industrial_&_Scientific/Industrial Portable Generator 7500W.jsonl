The WEN 6800-Watt Inverter Generator provides clean energy, free of voltage spikes and drops, without all the noise of a regular generator. Produce up to 6800 surge watts and 5100 rated watts of power on gasoline, or connect a propane tank using the tool-free quick-connector for up to 6000 surge watts and 4500 rated watts of power on LPG. The keyless electric start lets you turn on your generator at the press of a button, and includes a recoil starter as backup. The WEN Watchdog CO Shutdown Sensor helps protect both you and your family by automatically turning off the generator if dangerous levels of carbon monoxide are detected. Our 224cc engine operates at a modest 64 decibels at quarter load. This limits its invasiveness while camping, hunting, tailgating, and restoring backup power. The WEN 6800W Inverter Generator is also equipped with fuel shutoff. This feature turns off the flow of fuel, allowing for the generator to use up the remaining fuel from the carburetor before automatically shutting down. This helps fight the build-up and blockages caused by stagnant fuel inside of the carburetor, minimizing maintenance while prolonging the unit\u2019s lifespan. Designed to mirror a pure sine wave, this generator limits total harmonic distortion to under 0.3 percent at no load and under 1.2 percent at full load, making it safe to run laptops, cellphones, monitors, tablets and other sensitive electronics. The built-in wheels and telescoping handle make for easy portability while the ultra-efficient 2.9-gallon tank provides up to 6.1 hours of half-load run time (or 9 hours half-load run time on a 20-pound LPG tank). The fully-packed panel comes equipped with one 120V/240V NEMA transfer-switch or electric-vehicle-ready L14-30R receptacle, two three-prong 120V NEMA 5-20R receptacles, one 12V DC receptacle, one 120V TT-30R RV receptacle, a voltage selector switch, and two 5V USB ports. Maximize fuel economy by engaging the eco-mode switch. This allows the generator's engine to automatically adjust its fuel consumption as items are plugged into and unplugged from the panel, preventing the unnecessary usage of gasoline. Need more energy? Easily link up any two 240V WEN inverter generators using a WEN 240V Parallel Connection Kit (sold separately) in order to share wattage amongst multiple units. Low-oil and low-fuel automatic shutdown combine with the built-in overload protection and indicator lights to safeguard both your generator and your electronics from damage. The bonded-neutral 240V configuration provides low-power Level 2 battery EV charging for peace of mind when your electric vehicle is off the grid. And because this is a WEN Product, your inverter generator comes backed by a 3-year limited warranty, a nationwide network of skilled service technicians, and a friendly customer helpline.
