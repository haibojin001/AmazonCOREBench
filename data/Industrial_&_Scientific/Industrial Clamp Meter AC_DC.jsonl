When the Meter senses a weak AC signal, the green indicator light will come on and the buzzer will emit a slow, audible beep. when the Meter senses a strong AC signal, the red indicator light will come on and the buzzer will emit a brief beep.", "Multifunctional & Easy to read: Support Data Hold, Max/Min, Auto power off after 15 minutes inactivity, low battery indicator and continuity buzzer. The LCD Backlit Screen and Flashlight make it easy to use in a dark working area. ZERO function decreases the data error influenced by the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, and helps you to obtain a more accurate measurement.", "Large Jaw Opening: The jaw opening measures current in a conductor without touching or interrupting the circuit. Its slim and compact size makes it easy to operate in narrow spaces. This clamp meter has passed the environmental pollution test degree 2 and overvoltage category III 600V safety standards.", "Additional Tips: To measure the current you need to clamp the meter around one of the wires and not the whole power cord. Ensure the conductor to betested is in the center of the clamp head. The clamp Jaw is only used to measure current. Do not measure voltage by clamping the conductor being measured.", "Professional Technical Support Team - If you have any questions about the product, feel free to contact us!
