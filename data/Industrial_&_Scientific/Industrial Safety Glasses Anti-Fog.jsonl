Uvex stands for \"Ultra Violet Excluded\", which means our safety glasses employ specifically formulated resins that filter 99.9% of the UV radiation in accordance to the U6 scale of the Z87 standard. Uvex has also developed Spectrum Control Technology SCT, which incorporates unique dyes designed to absorb select wavelengths of radiant energy light. Our anti-glare glasses, tinted safety glasses and safety sunglasses are designed to manipulate light to reduce a spectral hazard, or to provide distinctive filtration for specific safety eyewear viewing tasks. Examples include filtering solar radiation to reduce glare, and blocking radiation from welding to protect workers around these operations. Multiple anti-fog and anti-scratch coatings are also available. The new HydroShield technology provides our best anti-fog lens coating, keeping your vision clear up to 90X longer than most other competitive anti-fog safety glasses. Models with the Uvextreme Plus anti-fog coating offer superior fog-free vision that lasts up to 10X longer than most other anti-fog coatings. Both anti-fog coatings provide 2X greater scratch resistance than most competitive anti-fog glasses. Our scratch-resistant safety glasses feature a durable hardcoat for long-lasting resistance to scuffing and scratching. Photochromic lenses offer seamless shade transitioning when moving from indoor work environments to mid-light and outdoor work areas. The full-frame design makes for strong impact-resistant glasses in accordance with ANSI Z87.1-2015 impact standards. The sport-inspired wraparound styling provides excellent side protection and peripheral vision. A molded nose piece and padded temples with molded inserts ensure your protective eyewear delivers longwearing comfort."], "product_details": ["Manufacturer \u200eHoneywell Safety Products, USA", "Part Number \u200eS2940HS", "Item Weight \u200e1.6 ounces", "Product Dimensions \u200e6.6 x 2.7 x 2.2 inches", "Item model number \u200eS2940HS", "Is Discontinued By Manufacturer \u200eNo", "Size \u200eOne Size", "Color \u200eBlack Frame", "Style \u200eModern", "Finish \u200eanti-fog, anti-glare, scratch-resistant", "Material \u200ePolycarbonate (PC)", "Thickness \u200e11 Inches", "Item Package Quantity \u200e1", "Measurement System \u200eMetric", "UV Protection \u200etrue", "Special Features \u200eAnti-Fog, Scratch Resistant", "Included Components \u200esafety glasses", "Batteries Included? \u200eNo", "Batteries Required? \u200eNo", "Warranty Description \u200eManufacturer Warranty", "ASIN B078MHL691", "Customer Reviews 4.5 4.5 out of 5 stars (1,290)", "Best Sellers Rank #62,309 in Tools & Home Improvement ( See Top 100 in Tools & Home Improvement ) #330 in Safety Glasses", "Date First Available November 25, 2017"], "images": "{\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617ru9QOymL._AC_SX679_.jpg\":[358,679],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617ru9QOymL._AC_SX569_.jpg\":[300,569],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617ru9QOymL._AC_SX425_.jpg\":[224,425],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617ru9QOymL._AC_SX522_.jpg\":[275,522],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617ru9QOymL._AC_SX355_.jpg\":[187,355],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617ru9QOymL._AC_SX450_.jpg\":[237,450],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617ru9QOymL._AC_SX466_.jpg\":[246,466]}", "rating": "4.5 out of 5 stars", "number_of_reviews": "(1,290)", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/B078MHL691/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-S2940HS-Hypershock-Safety-Glasses/dp/B078MHL691"}
