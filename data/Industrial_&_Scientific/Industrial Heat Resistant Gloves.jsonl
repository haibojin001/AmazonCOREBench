{"name": "BBQ Fireproof Gloves, Grill Cut-Resistant 1472\u00b0F Heat Resistant Gloves, Non-Slip Silicone Oven Gloves, Kitchen Safe Cooking Gloves for Oven Mitts,Barbecue,Cooking, Frying,13.8 Inch-Red", "price": "$8.99", "short_description": ["\u3010High Quality Three-Layer Material\u3011: This heat-resistant BBQ glove is composed of three materials. The first layer of silicone provides anti slip grip strength, ensuring that items in your hands are not easily slipped off. The second layer is made of ultra-high strength aramid fiber, known for its high temperature resistance and resistance to repeated use. The innermost layer adopts a knitted design, enhancing the comfort and breathability of the gloves, so you don't have to worry about the sticky feeling caused by sweat. When using silicone or cloth insulated gloves to remove hot food from the oven, which can easily burn your wrist. Choose our heat-resistant gloves to solve your problem.", "\u3010Enhanced Heat Resistance\u3011Although our grilling gloves have excellent heat resistance, it should be noted that all heat-resistant materials have their limits. Our heat resistant gloves can hold for 10 seconds when the temperature reaches 800 degrees Celsius (1472 degrees Fahrenheit). Generally speaking, the higher the temperature of an object, the shorter the holding time. For example, you can safely hold a hot metal baking tray taken out of a 200 degree Fahrenheit oven for longer than holding a hot metal pizza tray taken out of a 500 degree Fahrenheit oven. But for your safety, please avoid direct contact with open flames and avoid prolonged exposure to high temperatures to prevent burns.", "\u3010Don't Exceed 10 Seconds\u3011You can use barbecue gloves to handle cast iron pots, adjust charcoal fires, and even move hot grills. Your hands never feel hot (please note, do not exceed 10 seconds, and a brief grip will not feel hot). Our oven gloves provide excellent protection for your wrists when used in the kitchen with ovens, microwave ovens, slow stew pots, frying pans, barbecue grills, or near fireplaces, smoking ovens, or outdo or fire pits.", "\u3010Easy to Wear, Clean and Store\u3011\uff1aThe two cooking gloves are identical and can be worn interchangeably. The oven mitts fit comfortably, move freely, and have flexible fingers, allowing you to easily grip clips or other kitchen utensils. The grill gloves length is also sufficient to protect your wrist and forearm, which are areas that many other gloves cannot cover. This barbecue glove is easy to put on and take off, slightly elastic, and can adapt to various hand shapes. The BBQ gloves are equipped with an additional hanging rope design for easy hanging and drying after washing. Grilling gloves can be hand washed or machine washed. Basically suitable for everyone.", "\u3010Friendly Reminder\u3011Although our barbecue gloves have excellent heat resistance and flame retardancy, which can prolong the time you hold high-temperature objects, please note that all heat-resistant materials have their limitations. BBQ gloves don't provide permanent fire and insulation protection. Please avoid prolonged direct contact with open flames and high temperatures during use to prevent burns. These gloves are very useful and will become a regular part of your outdoor barbecue tools and accessories. I have confidence in the quality of our products. We offer a one-year warranty period. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us and we will solve them within 12 hours!"], "product_description": null, "product_details": ["Color Red", "Brand DKHDBD", "Outer Material Silicone", "Product Dimensions 13.5\"L x 8\"W", "Product Care Instructions Machine Wash", "Shape Hand", "Fill Material Cotton, Polyester", "Number of Pieces 2", "UPC 600358140276", "Item Weight 10.2 ounces", "Manufacturer DKHDBD", "ASIN B09MT5N7Z2", "Customer Reviews 4.4 4.4 out of 5 stars (3,065)", "Best Sellers Rank #833 in Patio, Lawn & Garden ( See Top 100 in Patio, Lawn & Garden ) #3 in Protective Grilling Mitts & Potholders", "Date First Available January 2, 2022"], "images": "{\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81joTZxV9pL._AC_SY450_.jpg\":[450,450],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81joTZxV9pL._AC_SX679_.jpg\":[679,679],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81joTZxV9pL._AC_SX466_.jpg\":[466,466],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81joTZxV9pL._AC_SX425_.jpg\":[425,425],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81joTZxV9pL._AC_SX569_.jpg\":[569,569],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81joTZxV9pL._AC_SX522_.jpg\":[522,522],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81joTZxV9pL._AC_SY355_.jpg\":[355,355]}", "rating": "4.4 out of 5 stars", "number_of_reviews": "(3,065)", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/B09MT5N7Z2/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Fireproof-Cut-Resistant-Resistant-Non-Slip-Silicone/dp/B09MT5N7Z2"}
