The Enforcer is an easy-to-build, top performing, rubber band racer that can be assembled in a variety of different way making the Enforcer the perfect rubber band racer for just about any type of contest you can dream up. The Enforcer Kit comes ready-to-assemble with pre-cut and pre-drilled parts so you can be ready for action, and racing on the same day. As with all our kits, The Enforcer Kit comes with step-by-step instructions that are filled with tons of top secret performance tips and tricks that have been developed exclusively by Doc Fizzix so that you will have all the information you need to make The Enforcer Kit a winner. Includes our \"easy-to-wind\" and \"snag-free \" string release system that will not tangle and/or snag, a technique that was designed exclusively by Doc Fizzix to increase the performance of your vehicle. PERFORMANCE UPGRADES: The Enforcer uses our all new revolutionary pulley launch system that is designed to maximized the potential energy of a stretched rubber band into kinetic energy with almost zero loss of energy. The secret to the pulley launch system is that it is designed to stretches the rubber band instead of winding it as is common with other rubber band vehicles; our launch system will double the power output and double the torque of the system causing the Enforcer to \"rocket\" off the start line with an almost unfair advantage. TRAVEL DISTANCE: 30-45 meters (98 - 148 feet) The Enforcer comes with ultra-thin, low inertia, DVD layer wheels that are the same diameter as a normal CD/DVD but only half the thickness. Because these wheels are only half the thickness compared to a normal CD/DVD they have only half the rotational inertia and your vehicle will have a greater acceleration and a greater travel distance compared to a similar vehicle using normal CDs/DVDs. The travel distance will increase from 5-15 meters further compared to a similar vehicle using normal thickness CD/DVD wheels.
