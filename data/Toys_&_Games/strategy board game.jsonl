The Legend of the Archeans This game is centered on the legend of the Archean empire, a civilization that possessed the ability to control the Earth's core elements--fire, wind, water, and earth--through four sacred treasures. These treasures stayed hidden from enemies for years on the Forbidden Island, which was designed to sink if intruders ever attempted to capture them. Set the appropriate water level for your gaming skill, and let the adventures begin! Capture the Four Sacred Treasures Before the Island Sinks! Your team of adventurers must work together to keep the Forbidden Island from sinking as you seek the four treasures hidden within. The mission is carried out using different combinations of Flood, Treasure, and Adventurer Cards on the 24 tiles that make up the Forbidden Island. Once you've captured each treasure using the appropriate cards, you must make it to Fools' Landing and escape by helicopter in order to win. If the island sinks before you complete your tasks, the mission ends in defeat. Use Collaborative Play to Succeed Each player is dealt an Adventure Card and given a corresponding pawn before the game starts, designating him or her with a certain set of strengths. This game is designed so that instead of competing with other players, you work to find the treasures and find out how to best use each Adventurer's strengths through collaborative play. This stimulates problem-solving and strategy skills. What's in the Box Water level marker, water meter, 58 playing cards, 24 island tiles, 6 pawns, 4 treasure figurines, rules of play, Gamewright catalog, and comment card.
