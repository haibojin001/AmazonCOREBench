The technology that supports augmented reality will come and go, evolve and change. The underlying principles for creating exciting, useful augmented reality experiences are timeless. Augmented reality designed from a purely technological perspective will lead to an AR experience that is novel and fun for one-time consumption - but is no more than a toy. Imagine a filmmaking book that discussed cameras and special effects software, but ignored cinematography and storytelling! In order to create compelling augmented reality experiences that stand the test of time and cause the participant in the AR experience to focus on the content of the experience - rather than the technology - one must consider how to maximally exploit the affordances of the medium. Understanding Augmented Reality addresses core conceptual issues regarding the medium of augmented reality as well as the technology required to support compelling augmented reality. By addressing AR as a medium at the conceptual level in addition to the technological level, the reader will learn to conceive of AR applications that are not limited by today\u2019s technology. At the same time, ample examples are provided that show what is possible with current technology. Explore the different techniques, technologies and approaches used in developing AR applications Learn from the author's deep experience in virtual reality and augmented reality applications to succeed right off the bat, and avoid many of the traps that catch new developers and users of augmented reality experiences Some AR examples can be experienced from within the book using downloadable software Read more"], "product_details": ["Publisher \u200f : \u200e Morgan Kaufmann", "Publication date \u200f : \u200e June 19, 2013", "Edition \u200f : \u200e 1st", "Language \u200f : \u200e English", "Print length \u200f : \u200e 296 pages", "ISBN-10 \u200f : \u200e 0240824083", "ISBN-13 \u200f : \u200e 978-0240824086", "Item Weight \u200f : \u200e 1.2 pounds", "Dimensions \u200f : \u200e 7.5 x 0.7 x 9.25 inches", "Best Sellers Rank: #2,348,155 in Books ( See Top 100 in Books ) #488 in User Experience & Website Usability #528 in Computer Graphics #904 in Human-Computer Interaction (Books)", "#488 in User Experience & Website Usability", "#528 in Computer Graphics", "#904 in Human-Computer Interaction (Books)", "Customer Reviews: 3.2 3.2 out of 5 stars (7)"], "images": "{\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JIqXStFmL._SY522_.jpg\":[522,424],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JIqXStFmL._SY466_.jpg\":[466,378],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JIqXStFmL._SY425_.jpg\":[425,345],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JIqXStFmL._SY385_.jpg\":[385,313],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JIqXStFmL._SY342_.jpg\":[342,278]}", "rating": "3.2 out of 5 stars", "number_of_reviews": "(7)", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/0240824083/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Augmented-Reality-Concepts-Applications/dp/0240824083"}

The building blocks are already falling into place: cloud computing and 5G networks, AI computer vision algorithms, smart glasses and VR headsets, and mixed reality games like Pok\u00e9mon GO. But what\u2019s coming next is a fundamental shift in how we experience the world and interact with each other. Over the next decade, what we see and how we see it will no longer be bound by biology.

{"name": "Visualization and Engineering Design Graphics with Augmented Reality Third Edition", "price": "", "short_description": null, "product_description": ["This book is designed as a learning tool to help the aspiring engineer learn the language of engineering graphics. In this regard, this book is hardly unique, as there have been literally hundreds of books published in the past that had a similar goal. The main challenge faced by engineering graphics books comes from the difficulty of representing and describing three dimensional information on paper, which is a consequence of the two dimensional nature of printed materials. What makes this book invaluable is the use of Augmented Reality, a technology that will allow you to escape the limitations of traditional materials enabling you, the student, to truly visualize the objects being described in full 3D. To take full advantage of this book you will need a smartphone, tablet or computer with a camera, along with the apps provided.* Read more"], "product_details": ["Publisher \u200f : \u200e SDC Publications", "Publication date \u200f : \u200e August 11, 2019", "Edition \u200f : \u200e 3rd", "Language \u200f : \u200e English", "Print length \u200f : \u200e 386 pages", "ISBN-10 \u200f : \u200e 1630572691", "ISBN-13 \u200f : \u200e 978-1630572693", "Item Weight \u200f : \u200e 2.05 pounds", "Dimensions \u200f : \u200e 8.75 x 0.9 x 10.5 inches", "Best Sellers Rank: #944,045 in Books ( See Top 100 in Books ) #266 in CAD Graphic Design Guides #624 in Architectural Drafting & Presentation #4,394 in Computer Science (Books)", "#266 in CAD Graphic Design Guides", "#624 in Architectural Drafting & Presentation", "#4,394 in Computer Science (Books)", "Customer Reviews: 4.9 4.9 out of 5 stars (19)"], "images": "{\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mNf+qsVnL._SY425_.jpg\":[425,328],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mNf+qsVnL._SY342_.jpg\":[342,264],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mNf+qsVnL._SY466_.jpg\":[466,360],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mNf+qsVnL._SY385_.jpg\":[385,298],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61mNf+qsVnL._SY522_.jpg\":[522,403]}", "rating": "4.9 out of 5 stars", "number_of_reviews": "(19)", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/1630572691/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Visualization-Engineering-Graphics-Augmented-Reality/dp/1630572691"}

The material is data driven, digestible, and very actionable.\" RAY KURZWEIL, Author/Entrepreneur/Futurist \"A wide-reaching exploration of the intersections between AI, VR and AR: it's a mind-opener, and a source of reflection on how transformative and still unknown the future of communication, personal technology and even personal privacy might become.\" SCOTT STEIN, Editor at Large, CNET Over the last 100 years, technology has changed our world. Over the next decade it will transform our reality. We are entering a new technological age in which artificial intelligence and immersive media will transform society at all levels, mediating our lives by altering what we see, hear, and experience. Powered by immersive eyewear and driven by interactive AI agents, this new age of computing has the potential to make our world a magical place where the boundaries between the real and the virtual, the human and the artificial, rapidly fade away. If managed well, this could unleash a new age of abundance. If managed poorly, this technological revolution could easily go astray, deeply compromising our privacy, autonomy, agency, and even our humanity. In Our Next Reality, two industry veterans provide a data-driven debate on whether the new world we're creating will be a technological utopia or an AI-powered dystopia and give guidance on how to aim for the best future we can. With a Foreword by renowned author Neal Stephenson and section contributions from industry thought-leaders such as Peter H. Diamandis, Tom Furness, Phillip Rosedale, Tony Parisi, Avi Bar Zeev and Walter Parkes, this book answers over a dozen of the most pressing questions we face as artificial intelligence and spatial computing accelerates the digitization of our world. Find out why our actions in the next decade could determine the trajectory of our species for countless millennia. \"For anyone who wants to use AI and XR to help build the future, read this book to help you skillfully navigate a future of unprecedented danger and promise.\" JASON HINER, Editor in Chief, ZDNet \" Our Next Reality really is a must-read for anyone who wants to prepare for the massive AI and XR driven disruption coming our way.\" CHARLIE FINK, Author | Adjunct | Forbes Tech Columnist PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.
