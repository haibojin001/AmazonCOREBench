Trusted by millions of cat families and backed by 25+ years of expertise, FELIWAY MultiCat offers an easy, effective solution for creating a peaceful, multi-cat household. Manufacturer's Notice 1)Behaviorists recommend one litter box per cat plus one. Where are they located, they should be spread all over the house, not placed in just one room. Is there a food and water bowl per cat, but not located near each other. 2)The product will last up to 30 days. If it lasted 27-30 days this is within the expected duration of use. The variation depends on the ambient temperature, humidity and air flow present in the house or where the diffuser is placed. 3) All pets respond to pheromones, but the degree to which they respond is determined by many factors. How severe is the stress the cat is experiencing currently (it is easier to prevent than treat), has there been any positive changes to the environment (adding extra resources like litter boxes and food bowl), what are the cat's previous experiences (if one cat had a bad experience with a housemate they may have learned not to trust other cats)."], "product_details": ["Product Dimensions \u200e4.5 x 2.5 x 5 inches", "Item Weight \u200e5.6 ounces", "Manufacturer \u200eCeva Animal Health", "ASIN \u200eB01AVHPFDS", "Item model number \u200eCD89410Q", "Is Discontinued By Manufacturer \u200eNo", "Date First Available \u200eMarch 31, 2015", "Best Sellers Rank #645 in Pet Supplies ( See Top 100 in Pet Supplies ) #6 in Cat Relaxants"], "images": "{\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ppduBwEiL._SX425_.jpg\":[425,425],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ppduBwEiL._SX522_.jpg\":[522,522],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ppduBwEiL._SX385_.jpg\":[385,385],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ppduBwEiL._SX342_.jpg\":[342,342],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ppduBwEiL._SX466_.jpg\":[466,466]}", "rating": "3.9 out of 5 stars", "number_of_reviews": "(34,190)", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/B01AVHPFDS/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/CEVA-Animal-Health-MultiCat-Diffuser/dp/B01AVHPFDS"}

We recommend using an additional diffuser if the room is bigger than 700 square feet. We recommend plugging in the FELIWAY Optimum diffuser in the room where you cat spends the most time. Try not to plug the diffuser under items (e.g. shelves) or close to objects (e.g. behind curtain or doors) as this affects efficacy. We do not recommend plugging your diffuser in near your litterbox or in a hallway - your cat likely does not spend as much time in the places as you'd think. Use FELIWAY Optimum each month to create a constant calming environment for your cat. Each refill will last up to 30 days - we recommend replacing your refills on a monthly basis. Check the diffuser monthly and replace it twice a year (every six months) to guarantee the best effect. Do not use another plugin with FELIWAY Optimum refills. Additionally, do not use a FELIWAY Optimum diffuser with a refill of another brand. Make sure you are using a FELIWAY Optimum diffuser with your FELIWAY Optimum vials and refills. Each FELIWAY Optimum Diffuser comes with a plug adapted to the local electric systems. Please do not use this diffuser in a another country that has a different voltage or with an adapter: it may conduct serious security concerns.
