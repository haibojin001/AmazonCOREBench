This enzymatic cleaner continues working as long as the food source is present. Freshens with a light fresh scent. Use on carpets, hard floors, furniture, fabrics and more (see the product label for a complete list of fabrics). Do not use on untreated hardwood, leather, suede, silk or wool specialty fabrics. Always use this product at full strength. Just spray, wait 10 minutes, then blot up stain with a white cloth. When used as directed, this product is safe to use around your pets and in your home. Always use Nature\u2019s Miracle products first.
