Puppy Feeding Instructions Start puppies on moistened Purina ONE as early as they will nibble at solid foods, generally 3 - 4 weeks of age. Allow your puppy to eat at will until fully weaned (6 - 8 weeks). After weaning, feed pups (to six months of age) all of the moistened or dry Purina ONE they will consume at intervals throughout the day. If water is added, use no more than one part warm (not hot) liquid to four parts Purina ONE, changing frequently to ensure freshness. If fed dry, this formula may be kept before pups at all times. For best results, develop a regular feeding schedule, such as three small meals a day for younger puppies. Gradually reduce to one feeding in the morning and one in the evening as your puppy ages. The routine should not vary. When Feeding for Reproduction Purina ONE provides the extra nutrition needed by reproducing females in stages of gestation and lactation. Food consumption may vary during gestation, so feed the amount needed to maintain the pregnant female\u2019s good body condition. Food intake may double or even quadruple during lactation. The Importance of Ideal Body Condition Nestl\u00e9 Purina Research indicates that avoiding overfeeding of puppies may help their development. Maintaining ideal body condition is key to encouraging proper growth in all puppies, especially large breeds. The indicated amounts are only a guideline. If your puppy becomes overweight, a reduction of his daily food intake may be appropriate. You may wish to consult your veterinarian about a weight control program. Making the Switch to Purina ONE Although you\u2019ll be anxious to see the difference Purina ONE can make in your puppy, please allow 7 - 10 days to ease the transition from your puppy\u2019s current food. Each day, simply feed a little less of the previous food and a little more Purina ONE until you\u2019re feeding Purina ONE exclusively. This gradual transition will help avoid dietary upsets. No Supplements Necessary Purina ONE provides 100% complete and balanced nutrition for the growth of puppies and reproducing females in stages of gestation and lactation. There is no need to add vitamins, minerals or other supplements, unless specifically directed by a veterinarian. Fresh Water, Proper Diet & Veterinary Care Be sure to provide fresh water in a clean container for your puppy daily. Proper diet, exercise and veterinary care are the best ways to keep your puppy healthy. If your puppy hasn\u2019t had a check-up in the past year, please make an appointment today.", "Warranty Description Purina guarantees outstanding quality and taste.
