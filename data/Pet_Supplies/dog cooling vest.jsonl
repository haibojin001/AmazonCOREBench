Designed for hot summer days, this vest uses evaporative technology to help your pup stay cool and comfortable during outdoor adventures. Just soak the vest in cold water, wring it out, and strap it on. As the water evaporates, it draws heat from your dog\u2019s body, making it a must-have for summer hikes, park days, and camping trips. The vest is made with lightweight polyester and lined with breathable air mesh, combining comfort with functionality. Its athletic cut offers a snug fit without restricting movement, and the light gray exterior helps reflect sunlight to reduce heat absorption. The design centers the cooling effect on your dog\u2019s core\u2014where it matters most\u2014making it more efficient than standard dog shirts or jackets. Built for real-life usability, the vest includes a two-way zipper that gives you access to a collar or harness underneath. Adjustable side straps with quick-release buckles ensure a secure fit for dogs of various sizes, while reflective accents boost visibility during early morning runs or evening walks. When the cooling effect fades, simply rewet the vest to recharge it again. Whether you\u2019re training on trails or relaxing at the lake, this cooling vest keeps your dog ready for whatever comes next. It\u2019s durable, machine washable, and easy to pack\u2014perfect for any adventure-ready pup.
