Types of motor oil include conventional, synthetic, diesel, bio-based, hybrid (blends of conventional and synthetic), and recycled oils. Motor oil varies in weight and viscosity, as well as additives that some manufacturers add to the oil during the refining process. A numerical code system created by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) grades motor oils according to viscosity--the higher the number between 0 and 60, the more viscous (thicker) the oil is. Most consumer motor oils are graded by two numbers, with the first number indicating cold weather (Winter or \"W\") performance. SAE 5W-20 This oil has a weight of SAE 5W-20, meaning it has an SAE viscosity rating of 5 in cold temperatures and a rating of 20 at normal operating temperature. Always check your vehicle's owner's manual to verify that this is the correct weight of motor oil for your vehicle. Conventional Motor Oil This oil is a conventional motor oil, meaning it is refined from crude oil or petroleum products. Conventional motor oils may or may not have additives included after refining. Conventional motor oils are more versatile than synthetic or hybrid motor oils, because they are suitable for use with nearly all types of modern vehicle engines, from cars and trucks to motorcycles, ATVs, farm equipment, and more. High Mileage Oil This oil is primarily designed for use in high-mileage cars and trucks, including both older vehicles and new vehicles that see heavy long-distance use. Extra additives are included to minimize compression loss, and to condition rubber seals and gaskets to prevent fluid leakage in older or high-mileage vehicles."], "product_details": ["Viscosity \u200e5W-20", "Brand \u200ePennzoil", "Vehicle Service Type \u200eCar, Truck, UTV", "UPC \u200e071611808859", "Global Trade Identification Number \u200e00071611808859", "Manufacturer \u200ePennzoil", "Size \u200e1 Quart", "SAE J300 Viscosity Grade \u200e5W-20", "Model \u200e550022818", "Item Weight \u200e11.97 pounds", "Package Dimensions \u200e9.45 x 8.94 x 7.95 inches", "Item model number \u200e550022818-6PK", "Manufacturer Part Number \u200e550022818", "OEM Part Number \u200e550022818", "ASIN B006A49EDE", "Customer Reviews 4.7 4.7 out of 5 stars (850)", "Best Sellers Rank #1,597 in Automotive ( See Top 100 in Automotive ) #29 in Motor Oils", "Date First Available September 25, 2014"], "images": "{\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BN9xVYZAL._AC_SX569_PIbundle-6,TopRight,0,0_SH20_.jpg\":[569,569],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BN9xVYZAL._AC_SX466_PIbundle-6,TopRight,0,0_SH20_.jpg\":[466,466],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BN9xVYZAL._AC_SY355_PIbundle-6,TopRight,0,0_SH20_.jpg\":[355,355],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BN9xVYZAL._AC_SY450_PIbundle-6,TopRight,0,0_SH20_.jpg\":[450,450],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BN9xVYZAL._AC_SX425_PIbundle-6,TopRight,0,0_SH20_.jpg\":[425,425],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BN9xVYZAL._AC_SX522_PIbundle-6,TopRight,0,0_SH20_.jpg\":[522,522],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BN9xVYZAL._AC_SX679_PIbundle-6,TopRight,0,0_SH20_.jpg\":[679,679]}", "rating": "4.7 out of 5 stars", "number_of_reviews": "(850)", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/B006A49EDE/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Pennzoil-Mileage-Motor-5W-20-Quart/dp/B006A49EDE"}
