Max-Boost is formulated for engines equipped with carburetors, port fuel injection and direct injection, as well as turbocharged, supercharged and nitrous-injected engines. Safe for use in leaded and unleaded gasoline's, and alternate fuels like gasohol, reformulated gasoline, and all ethanol blends. Max-Boost is safe for oxygen sensors and catalytic converters.
