The Absorbed Glass Mat design is 100% leak and spill proof because the Electrolyte is permanently held in the glass mat separator instead of free flowing within each cell. Oxygen recombination reduces water loss and reassures maintenance-free performance. ACDelco Professional Automotive AGM Batteries have longer life expectancy in traditional vehicle applications, due to a maintained pressure on the plates which significantly reduces the amount of active mass lost from the grid. ACDelco Professional Automotive AGM Batteries also have a 36 month Free Replacement Period. PROPOSITION 65 WARNING: Battery posts, terminals and related accessories contain lead and lead compounds, chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects and other reproductive harm. Batteries also contain other chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer. Wash hands after handling.\u2022 MAINTENANCE TIPS: Check the auto battery as part of regular vehicle maintenance. Keep auto battery terminals clean and free of corrosion. To remove corrosion from terminals use a terminal brush. Check the alternator and make sure that it is not charging too high or low \u2013 if the alternator is not charging properly it will cause the battery to not charge correctly and cause deterioration. Avoid exposing the auto battery to extreme heat whenever possible.Turn off other electrical accessories (stereos, internal lights, etc.) as soon as they are no longer required to save electrical energy."], "product_details": ["Brand \u200eACDelco", "Size \u200eStandard", "Product Dimensions \u200e7.5\"D x 11.9\"W x 7.6\"H", "Number Of Cells \u200e6", "Resistance \u200e0.02 Ohms", "OEM Part Number \u200e88864541", "Manufacturer \u200eACDelco", "UPC \u200e707773904015", "Item Weight \u200e45.5 pounds", "Item model number \u200e48AGM", "Manufacturer Part Number \u200e88864541", "Amperage \u200e70 Amps", "ASIN B008FWCLHU", "Customer Reviews 4.5 4.5 out of 5 stars (2,048)", "Best Sellers Rank #6,328 in Automotive ( See Top 100 in Automotive ) #28 in Automotive Replacement Batteries", "Date First Available June 28, 2012"], "images": "{\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Tz+NRppYL._AC_SX522_.jpg\":[422,522],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Tz+NRppYL._AC_SX425_.jpg\":[343,425],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Tz+NRppYL._AC_SX569_.jpg\":[460,569],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Tz+NRppYL._AC_SX355_.jpg\":[287,355],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Tz+NRppYL._AC_SX679_.jpg\":[549,679],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Tz+NRppYL._AC_SX450_.jpg\":[364,450],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Tz+NRppYL._AC_SX466_.jpg\":[377,466]}", "rating": "4.5 out of 5 stars", "number_of_reviews": "(2,048)", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/B008FWCLHU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/ACDelco-48AGM-Professional-Automotive-Battery/dp/B008FWCLHU"}
