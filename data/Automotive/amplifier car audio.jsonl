Designing the most efficient, well built, high quality amplifiers is where we start here at Skar Audio, and that is exactly what is delivered in the RP-1500.1D. The RP-1500.1D is 1-ohm stable and utilizes a wide array premium internal components that make it extremely powerful and reliable - such as its high speed MOSFET power supply and advanced PCB board layout. Conservatively rated at 1,500 watts RMS power at a 1-ohm load, with the capabilities of reaching beyond 1,900 watts at max power output. This amplifier is by far one of the most popular and affordable mono-blocks we have ever released, and is great for powering a \"daily driver\" subwoofer stage in any vehicle. Furthermore, the oversized 4-gauge power and ground terminals found on the amplifier allow for maximum current flow and therefore higher power output and more efficient operation. You'll have full reign over your amplifier with the built-in user control panel, featuring a bass EQ switch (0, +6, +12dB), and variable adjustment tunings for gain level, low-pass filter, and subsonic filter. In addition to all the above features, this model also features 4-way protection circuitry, which will give the user the peace of mind knowing they are protected against damage to the amplifier for various reasons - including electrical shortage, overheating, low voltage, and more. This amplifier comes with a remote subwoofer level control (bass knob) allowing the user to have full control over their bass from the front of the vehicle."], "product_details": ["Item dimensions L x W x H 19.5 x 7 x 3 inches", "Manufacturer Skar Audio", "Mounting Type Surface Mount", "Brand Skar Audio", "Number of Channels 1", "Output Power 1900 Watts", "Specification Met FCC", "Material Semiconductor", "Global Trade Identification Number 00760999042732", "UPC 760999042732", "Product Dimensions 19.5 x 7 x 3 inches", "Item Weight 8.2 pounds", "ASIN B00TKE7APU", "Item model number RP-1500.1D", "Customer Reviews 4.6 4.6 out of 5 stars (7,792)", "Best Sellers Rank #1,125 in Electronics ( See Top 100 in Electronics ) #1 in Car Mono Amplifiers", "Is Discontinued By Manufacturer No", "Date First Available February 10, 2015"], "images": "{\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TqP7VFO1L._AC_SX679_.jpg\":[679,679],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TqP7VFO1L._AC_SX466_.jpg\":[466,466],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TqP7VFO1L._AC_SY355_.jpg\":[355,355],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TqP7VFO1L._AC_SX425_.jpg\":[425,425],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TqP7VFO1L._AC_SX522_.jpg\":[522,522],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TqP7VFO1L._AC_SY450_.jpg\":[450,450],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TqP7VFO1L._AC_SX569_.jpg\":[569,569]}", "rating": "4.6 out of 5 stars", "number_of_reviews": "(7,792)", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/B00TKE7APU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Skar-Audio-RP-1500-1D-Monoblock-Amplifier/dp/B00TKE7APU"}
