A custom wiring harness -- also called a T-connector -- is a simple, plug-and-play electrical device that plugs into your automotive electric system and provides a standard, universal trailer wiring connection. This is done using two or more vehicle-specific, OEM-compatible connectors to plug into the taillight assembly, eliminating the need for cutting, splicing and soldering during installation. Custom wiring harnesses are made vehicle-specific, and while they are not available for all vehicles, they do offer one of the fastest, easiest and most secure ways to wire a vehicle for towing. This particular plug-in harness provides a 4-way flat connector socket and is designed to be a custom wiring harness to fit certain years of the Kia Sorento and Sportage with LED taillights (to verify your vehicle compatibility, see application info). It comes with all necessary wiring components to establish a reliable trailer wiring connection, as well as a dust cover to keep the connector clean when not in use. You have a picture in mind of your next destination -- maybe it's the boat landing at your favorite fishing spot, maybe it's a campsite that overlooks one of nature's masterpieces, or maybe it's the next big jobsite. However, turning that picture into a reality takes more than just daydreaming. It takes a solid connection and the right amount of power. CURT custom wiring is made with some of the most sophisticated technology in the industry and is designed to install with ease, giving you a long-lasting electrical connection for your towing hitch setup."], "product_details": ["Brand \u200eCURT", "Vehicle Service Type \u200eMarine-Personal-Craft, Trailer", "Material \u200eTHERMOPLASTIC RUBBER", "Automotive Fit Type \u200eVehicle Specific Fit", "Manufacturer \u200eCURT", "UPC \u200e612314564743", "Model \u200eCustom Wiring", "Item Weight \u200e1.57 pounds", "Product Dimensions \u200e6 x 9 x 3 inches", "Item model number \u200e56474", "Manufacturer Part Number \u200e56474", "ASIN B0BCSFZJ9C", "Customer Reviews 4.2 4.2 out of 5 stars (74)", "Best Sellers Rank #277,222 in Automotive ( See Top 100 in Automotive ) #526 in Towing Hitch Wiring", "Date First Available September 1, 2022"], "images": "{\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/819udPIz41L._AC_SY450_.jpg\":[450,450],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/819udPIz41L._AC_SX679_.jpg\":[679,679],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/819udPIz41L._AC_SX522_.jpg\":[522,522],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/819udPIz41L._AC_SX425_.jpg\":[425,425],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/819udPIz41L._AC_SX466_.jpg\":[466,466],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/819udPIz41L._AC_SX569_.jpg\":[569,569],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/819udPIz41L._AC_SY355_.jpg\":[355,355]}", "rating": "4.2 out of 5 stars", "number_of_reviews": "(74)", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/B0BCSFZJ9C/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/CURT-56474-Vehicle-Side-Trailer-Sportage/dp/B0BCSFZJ9C"}
