And our aerosol 2K Caliper Paint does not disappoint! We offer high quality premium 2K aerosol spray paints which adhere so well that they can be sprayed right over rust! How many cans does it take to spray all four calipers? One 2k High Temp Caliper Spray paint can should be enough to apply 2-3 coats on 4 calipers. Our caliper paint resists chipping flaking fading and has superior chemical protection against brake cleaner lacquer thinner acetone brake fluid etc. Our spray paint is not typical rattle can paint: it is formulated as a 2K paint - which means a catalyst is introduced into the paint at application which creates a chemical reaction that causes the paint to quickly cure with a very hard surface. How do I prep my calipers for painting? Failing to prep is prepping to fail so we at ERA always emphasize the significance of prep efforts. Calipers need a thorough cleaning with a wire brush and warm water and dish soap detergent. Then degreaser needs to be applied to remove any impurities and oil/grease. The next step is to tape up your calipers to prevent overspray Once your prep is done it is time to paint How do I use the 2k High temp spray paint? Introduce the catalyst into the paint. Shake the can vigorously and spray 1 or 2 coats.
