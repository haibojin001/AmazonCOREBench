Faster In Tight Spaces Than Our Standard Wrench Our extra precise ratcheting wrench is faster to use in tight spaces than a standard wrench, because it allows you to have continuous engaged with the bolt while you tighten it. Reseating bolts in tight, dark spaces kills your productivity. In our tests, we have seen huge speed improvements in tight spaces over our standard wrench. We couldn't be happier! Prevent Stripping Bolts! Another downside of reseating bolts over and over, is it can round out and destroy the bolt head. Once the bolt head has been rounded and you aren't finished, your project goes on hold until you can fix or replace the bolt. This can take hours! Additionally, our contact points are designed to quickly grip critical areas of the fastener to support maximum force transfer while preventing rounding. Our Strongest Steel Ever! To make our drop forged tool even stronger, we added the best strengthening agent for steel: vanadium! And if you want numbers, our hardened steel is 67% percent stronger than other steels. Our TightSpot Wrench is Perfect For: - Electricians - Technicians - Home Projects - Lawn Care Equipment Dare To Compare!
