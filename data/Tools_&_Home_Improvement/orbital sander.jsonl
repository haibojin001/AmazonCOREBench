This palm sander is loaded with features to reduce vibration and noise and increase ergonomics and operator comfort. These features include a comfortable rubber grip and a recessed lever platform that eliminates pinching and pressure points on the operator\u2019s palm. An innovative internal muffler helps reduce noise and won\u2019t break off during use. A Stikit disc pad is included with this 5 inch random orbital sander, allowing the operator to quickly and easily apply adhesive-backed discs to the sanding tool. 3M pneumatic orbital sanders are designed to optimize the performance of 3M abrasives, with speed control and a low-profile, balanced design. 3/16\u201d diameter orbit provides a moderate cut-rate and a fine finish on metal, composites, wood and more. Operates at 90 psi with an air flow rate of 17 SCFM. The 3M\u2122 Random Orbital Sander 20317 non-vacuum tool is air-powered and delivers professional performance and a swirl-free finish hour after hour in high-production industrial environments where dust extraction is not required. Designed to optimize the performance of 3M\u2122 Abrasives, this high-quality 3M tool features a 5\" diameter suitable for most applications, and a 3/16\" orbit ideal for general purpose operations. Built with a powerful, precision-balanced 0.28 hp motor and durable lightweight aluminum housing, 3M pneumatic random orbital sanders run smoothly and are built to last. Use them with a wide selection of 3M abrasives and accessories. A 3M\u2122 Stikit\u2122 Disc Pad is included. Disc Pad Included for Optimal Performance 3M sanders perform best when paired with 3M disc pads and abrasives. The disc pad included with the tool reduces vibrations for smoother running, provides reliable disc adhesion, and enables optimal performance of the tool. The box includes one 5\" 3M Stikit Low Profile Disc Pad 20351 recommended for flat sanding operations, for use with 5\" Stikit discs (sold separately). This versatile sander also works with 3M\u2122 Hookit\u2122 disc pads, enabling operators to use Scotch-Brite\u2122 discs in addition to coated abrasive discs. Using Your Pneumatic Sander This tool is intended to be operated as a handheld tool and is air-powered. It requires an air compressor that will provide a clean lubricated air supply with an airflow rate of 17 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM), or 481 liters per minute (LPM), and 90 pounds per square inch (psi) at the tool, i.e. the point where the air hose is connected to the tool, when the tool is running with the level fully depressed. Recommended is an approved 3/8 inch (10 mm) airline at the minimum length required for the application, with a maximum length of 25 feet (8 m). For more details about connecting the tool to your air supply, see the Instruction Manual. Max RPM is 12,000 at 90 psi. Why Choose a Random Orbital Sander? 3M random orbital sanders optimize sanding and surface preparation on wood, metal, fiberglass and composite materials, and many other substrates. Also known as dual action (D/A) palm sanders, these industrial-grade tools rotate the abrasive disc and disc pad in two simultaneous overlapping oval patterns so no single abrasive particle follows the same path twice, producing a random scratch and swirl-free finish ready for paint or varnish.
