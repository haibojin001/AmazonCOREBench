The new CP74 Series has been designed to optimize productivity and operator comfort. Delivering up to 20% more power than the CP91 range and with a collet design for quick and easy burr changes, the CP74 pneumatic die grinders can help optimize productivity in metal fabrication applications, as well as vehicle servicing and repair. Spindle lock system: The CP74 Series of \u00bc\u201d and 6 mm pneumatic die grinders are equipped with a novel locking spindle system that makes changing the carbide burrs quicker and easier than standard die grinders needing two spanner wrenches. By removing the use of one spanner wrench operators no longer have to place the tool in a vice or between their knees, reducing production stoppage times and improving productivity. High application coverage: CP74 die grinders further contribute to operational efficiency by offering a choice of six different heads \u2014 short or long, straight or angle (120\u00b0, 90\u00b0) \u2014 to offer the best possible configuration for the application such as matching welded surface, deburring, and chamfering, etc. High comfort provided: User comfort is another key attraction of the CP74 Series. The grinder\u2019s handles are made from thermoplastic rubber (TPR) which ensures that the operator can maintain a good surface grip. In addition, the rugged composite casing on the CP74 die grinders acts as an insulator, reducing heat transfer between the motor and the sleeve. In combination, these features ensure that the operator can work comfortably for longer. Excellent power-to-weight performance: CP74 pneumatic die grinders operate between 22,000 and 28,000 rpm depending on the model. With the smallest grinder in the series weighing just 1.1 lb. (0.5 kg) and the largest grinder 2.43 lb. (1.1 kg), these tools offer excellent power-to-weight performance. Since its foundation in the United States in 1901, Chicago Pneumatic has established itself as the leader in the industry, offering best-in-class pneumatic tools.
