It is very convenient for work at home and space-saving work anywhere. Since the every blades of this series can be attached to a cutter body (L type), there is no need to buy another cutter body. Just switch blades. [Materials] Saw blade: steel. Body: Plastic. Gyokucho is the premier Japanese manufacturer of high quality saws with a reputation for reliability and good performance at a modest price. We use a method called impulse hardening to increase the durability of the tooth tips. The cutting edge is heated for 0.003 to 0.005 seconds by applying an electrical current at super high-frequency of 27.12Mhz, instantly hardening the surface of the steel while maintaining the flexibility inside. As a result, the saw\u2019s wear resistance increases. The surface hardness of the blade is approximately from Hv 900 to 1200. The hardened saw tooth is much harder than sharpening files so the blade cannot be sharpened and needs to be replaced once it is dull. All products have a name, blade thickness, the blade length, and even the extra blade part number marked on themselves. The marking is done by a laser irradiation method and won't wear off. So even when you lose the package, you can easily identify the products by checking its laser marking. Electro less nickel plating prevents the blade from rusting, and there is no need to worry cutting materials getting dirty with the rust.", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/B0034YR0CU/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Gyokucho-Industry-1160-RAZOR-Saw/dp/B0034YR0CU"}
