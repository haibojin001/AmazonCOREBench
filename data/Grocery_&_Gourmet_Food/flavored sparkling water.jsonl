Polar Seltzer Premium Sparkling Water. Tiny Bubbles: The sparkle sets us apart. We've been perfecting the process of making our signature bubbles, with their long-lasting carbonation and crispness, since 1882. The bubbles are created by carefully dissolving Co2 into water at high pressure and freezing temperatures without exposing the flavors to oxygen. Other people may add sodium or sweeteners to shortcut the road to quality \u2013 we do not. Natural Flavors: The taste of our seltzers is defined by the quality ingredients of the ingredients we used. Our approach is to use only the highest-quality, proprietary combinations of flavors and aromas for depth and complexity. These ingredients are extracted and distilled from natural sources (such as lemon peel, lime, mint, etc.) to create highly concentrated \u201cessences\u201d. Relying on copious amounts of these very precious oils, we never skimp when it comes to taste. Triple-Filtered & Locally Sourced Water: Our water is locally sourced and then triple-filtered with our state-of-the-art process to ensure a consistent and authentic Polar Seltzer taste. NO sodium, fluoride, or other funny business added. This is why Polar Seltzer makes for health smart hydration. Family Made Since 1882: Just water, zillions of tiny bubbles, and great taste. Our family has been crafting Polar Seltzer with these same ingredients since 1882. That\u2019s 138 years to perfect what our great-great-grandfather called the world\u2019s best-tasting bubble recipe.
