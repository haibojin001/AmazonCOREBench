We've kicked our Non-Dairy flavors up a notch with an OAT-standing new recipe. Prepare for this creamy, legendary, OAT of this world concoction. This flavor is our tribute to guitarist Jerry Garcia fans everywhere, and it all started with a piece of fan mail. You see, back in the day, before smartphones and social media, our fans spoke to us via handwritten notes pinned to the bulletin boards at our Scoop Shops. Sometime in 1986, one such fan mailed a postcard to our main office in Burlington, Vermont. Ben & Jerry's meets great guitar solos? We loved the idea, and Ben immediately began creating the iconic concoction. Cherry Garcia debuted in 1987 and quickly became one of our top three most popular flavors. But just as every good musician has to evolve, Ben & Jerry's does, too. So in answer to queries from all of those air-guitar heroes who can\u2019t or choose not to eat dairy, we decided it was time to create this fan favorite into a vegan dessert. It\u2019s made with smooth and creamy OAT milk, which is the perfect blank canvas for the cherries and fudge flakes we pack into this pint. Same euphoria, minus the dairy\u2014and here\u2019s hoping it inspires at least a few soulful guitar riffs. Like all of our flavors, Cherry Garcia non-dairy is a gmo free and uses Fairtrade certified cocoa and vanilla. If that\u2019s not enough, we went one step further to gain 100% vegan and gluten free diet certification. All the flavor is wrapped in responsibly sourced packaging, so you can feel good about what\u2019s in your freezer."], "product_details": ["Product Dimensions \u200f : \u200e 3.88 x 3.88 x 4.11 inches; 14.5 ounces", "UPC \u200f : \u200e 076840674442", "Manufacturer \u200f : \u200e Unilever", "ASIN \u200f : \u200e B06XD55CJH", "Units \u200f : \u200e 16.0 Ounce", "Best Sellers Rank: #19,317 in Grocery & Gourmet Food ( See Top 100 in Grocery & Gourmet Food ) #3 in Plant-Based Ice Cream & Novelties", "#3 in Plant-Based Ice Cream & Novelties", "Customer Reviews: 4.6 4.6 out of 5 stars (1,560)"], "images": "{\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81eG2pP7OdL._SX679_.jpg\":[679,679],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81eG2pP7OdL._SX342_.jpg\":[342,342],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81eG2pP7OdL._SX522_.jpg\":[522,522],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81eG2pP7OdL._SX466_.jpg\":[466,466],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81eG2pP7OdL._SX569_.jpg\":[569,569],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81eG2pP7OdL._SX385_.jpg\":[385,385],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81eG2pP7OdL._SX425_.jpg\":[425,425]}", "rating": "4.6 out of 5 stars", "number_of_reviews": "(1,560)", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/B06XD55CJH/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Ben-Jerrys-Non-Dairy-Cherry-Garcia/dp/B06XD55CJH"}
