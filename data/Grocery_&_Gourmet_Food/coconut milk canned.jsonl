An ideal milk or cream substitute for vegan and paleo diets, Thai Kitchen's small-sized Coconut Milk adds the touch of texture that will take your family dinners, smooth beverages and indulgent desserts to the next level. About the Brand Thai Kitchen was founded in 1989 when Seth Jacobson made his first trip to Asia. It was during this first trip to Thailand that he fell in love with the land, the people and the cuisine. At an outdoor market in the center of a Thai village, he discovered the secret of why Thai cuisine is so astonishingly complex, rich and flavorful. The high quality of Thai cuisine was achieved by selecting and combining only the freshest ingredients without making any compromises. He noticed these authentic Thai dishes were made with an intricate combination of fresh ingredients such as lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, tamarind, Thai sweet basil, galangal, fish sauce and jasmine rice. Seth realized the Thai diet (based on grains, vegetables, herbs and spices) was perfectly positioned for the American market where consumers seek new exciting flavors and foods that are healthy. Being raised in the specialty food industry, he immediately saw the potential for this exotic and flavorful cuisine. Realizing this excellent opportunity to combine his knowledge of specialty foods with his newfound passion for the cuisine of Thailand, he began to develop relationships with Thai ingredient suppliers. At the time, there were no domestic suppliers providing Thai staple items like fish sauce, coconut milk and fresh curry pastes. He wanted to create an authentic Thai product line but knew that he could not achieve the true flavors of Thai cuisine by using ingredients found domestically. Therefore, he chose to work closely with Thai farmers to create the true authentic flavors of Thailand. In October of 1990, Thai Kitchen's first shipment, arriving at the port of Oakland, California, consisted of 8 core items representing the backbone of Thai cooking. Thai Kitchen sought to make Thai cooking easy for American consumers by providing easy to follow recipes, tantalizing descriptions and serving suggestions. Retailers and consumers embraced the product line with enthusiasm, especially with its upscale and engaging packaging.Thai restaurants were cropping up all over California and the West, where consumers were delighted to find that they could recreate the dishes they had enjoyed in their favorite restaurant at home. Seth Jacobson's commitment to a truly authentic Thai product line and desire to share his love of Thai cuisine & culture fueled the growth of the brand as well as the need to expand the product line. Thai Kitchen, a division of Epicurean International, Inc., has come a long way from the early days when Seth Jacobson sold curry pastes and fish sauce out of the trunk of his car to a handful of Bay Area accounts. Today, Thai Kitchen has over 45 products and is sold in 50 states, and Canada. Thai Kitchen is now found on the shelves of gourmet food shops, natural food stores, green grocers, ethnic markets and grocery stores. Thai Kitchen offers everything the American consumer is seeking: taste, quality, authenticity... the best of Thailand. With offices in the United States, Europe and Thailand, future plans are to continually develop unique and delicious products bringing consumers the sights, smells and flavors of Thailand. In 2005, Thai Kitchen opened Epicurean Kitchen - an intimate, non-for-profit, hands-on cooking school in the heart of Bangkok. Epicurean Kitchen is devoted to educating visitors about Thai cuisine and teaching them how to recreate the tastes, flavors and techniques at home."], "product_details": ["Is Discontinued By Manufacturer \u200f : \u200e No", "Product Dimensions \u200f : \u200e 12 x 9.25 x 5 inches; 12.64 Pounds", "Item model number \u200f : \u200e 880666", "UPC \u200f : \u200e 778894109870", "Manufacturer \u200f : \u200e McCormick & Company, Inc.", "ASIN \u200f : \u200e B000GZSDZI", "Units \u200f : \u200e 163.92 Fluid Ounces", "Best Sellers Rank: #3,603 in Grocery & Gourmet Food ( See Top 100 in Grocery & Gourmet Food ) #4 in Coconut Milk & Cream", "#4 in Coconut Milk & Cream", "Customer Reviews: 4.1 4.1 out of 5 stars (4,090)"], "images": "{\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YRWQMZYfL._SX342_PIbundle-12,TopRight,0,0_AA342SH20_.jpg\":[342,342],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YRWQMZYfL._SX522_PIbundle-12,TopRight,0,0_AA522SH20_.jpg\":[522,522],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YRWQMZYfL._SX385_PIbundle-12,TopRight,0,0_AA385SH20_.jpg\":[385,385],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YRWQMZYfL._SX679_PIbundle-12,TopRight,0,0_AA679SH20_.jpg\":[679,679],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YRWQMZYfL._SX466_PIbundle-12,TopRight,0,0_AA466SH20_.jpg\":[466,466],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YRWQMZYfL._SX569_PIbundle-12,TopRight,0,0_AA569SH20_.jpg\":[569,569],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81YRWQMZYfL._SX425_PIbundle-12,TopRight,0,0_AA425SH20_.jpg\":[425,425]}", "rating": "4.1 out of 5 stars", "number_of_reviews": "(4,090)", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/B000GZSDZI/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Thai-Kitchen-Coconut-Milk-13-66/dp/B000GZSDZI"}
