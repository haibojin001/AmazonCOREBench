{"name": "Eden Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, Raw, Unpasteurized with Mother, 16oz Glass", "price": "$13.03", "short_description": ["Organic, naturally fermented with 'mother' of vinegar."], "product_description": ["Eden Organic Apple Cider Vinegar is naturally fermented with 'mother' of vinegar, a friendly natural bacteria culture similar to 'starter' used to make country bread. Appearing as cloudiness in the final product, the presence of mother indicates the best quality raw vinegar. The apple juice goes through a primary fermentation to reach the desired alcohol content, and a secondary fermentation to change the alcohol into acetic acid. Then it is patiently aged. Eden Vinegar is bottled in amber glass to protect its flavor, bouquet and nutritional integrity. Apple Cider Vinegar is traditionally the most widely relied upon vinegar in North America. Its soothing, healthy, and rejuvenating effects are very well documented from diaries of the early pioneers to the Internet. Applied externally cider vinegar was used to soothe sunburns, bee stings, insect bites, athlete's foot, dandruff and acne; to soften dry skin, strengthen nails and restore luster and shine to dull hair. It is also used liberally to massage sore muscles. Vinegar has provided good health and zest to people for over 7,000 years. Most commercial vinegars are highly denatured through the use of extreme heat and chemical solvents. They are formulated rather than fermented. Please avoid any vinegar labeled 'distilled', as it is the most highly refined and least healthful. For the flavor and benefit of true raw vinegar choose Eden. Eden Organic Apple Cider Vinegar is an excellent ingredient for dressings and sauces. To make an old time Yankee tonic combine two teaspoons Eden Organic Apple Cider Vinegar and one teaspoon of good honey in a cup of water. A safe effective way to clean fruits and vegetables: soak them in water with a splash of Eden Organic Apple Cider Vinegar.
