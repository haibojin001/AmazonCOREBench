From the Manufacturer view larger Organically Nutritious The Orgain Story: Doctor Developed, Life Tested Orgain was founded in 2008 by Andrew Abraham, M.D. - a physician and cancer survivor who was disappointed with the nutritional shake offerings on the market. After being diagnosed with cancer, Dr. Abraham underwent extensive treatment, forcing him to rely on liquid nutrition. \"Mainstream brands were loaded with high fructose corn syrup, genetically modified soy, artificial flavors, preservatives and tasted horrible. I created Orgain out of necessity and focused on the highest quality, organic ingredients possible to develop a nutritionally complete, high protein nutritional shake that is now considered the gold standard in nutritional shakes by the top experts in the industry.\" Ready-to-Drink, USDA Organic Complete Nutritional Shake Orgain is a USDA certified organic nutritional shake loaded with 16 grams of organic protein, organic complex carbohydrates, organic fruits and veggies * and 23 vitamins and minerals. The Orgain Organic Protein Blend uses organic grass fed protein ** that is free of antibiotics and hormones along with organic brown rice to help provide nourishing nutrition and sustained energy. In addition to being nutrient dense, Orgain has a delicious taste from natural ingredients such as organic cocoa, organic chocolate, real organic vanilla beans and organic strawberry. Orgain is now being recommended at the top medical institutions in the nation and anyone from cancer patients to elite Olympic athletes are enjoying the numerous benefits of real organic nutrition. Orgain is Perfect For: Busy and active lifestyles Breakfast on the go Pre or post-workout replenishment Organic nutrient dense energy any time Weight management A nutritionally complete base for smoothies Anyone who requires liquid nutrition *Orgain organic fruit and vegetable blend: Organic kale, organic beet, organic spinach, organic carrot, organic tomato, organic blueberry, organic banana, organic acai, organic apple, organic raspberry. *Orgain organic protein blend: While a vast majority of protein shakes use non-organic protein, Orgain features organic, grass fed protein, which means no hormones, antibiotics or medications. Furthermore, higher levels of CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) and a higher ratio of Omega 3\u2019s to Omega-6\u2019s compared to conventional grain fed protein.
