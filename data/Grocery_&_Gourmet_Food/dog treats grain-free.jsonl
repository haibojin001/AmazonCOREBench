This commitment drives our choices, from how we raise our animals, to the ingredients we choose, to the kitchens we use. You\u2019ll notice the difference the second you open a bag of our natural dog treats. Our Full Moon treats are made with love in the USA. We work exclusively with the trusted family farmers and ranchers we\u2019ve been in business with for years, ensuring that animals are raised to the highest ethical standards. Every bite begins with USDA-approved, human-grade meat\u2014 cooked in gleaming kitchens using only 100% natural ingredients\u2014and ends with a satisfied pup. Each of our healthy snacks, like Full Moon Essential Beef Sticks, are free of artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors and full of things dogs love. Glycerin and fillers like corn, wheat, and soy have no place in our recipes. In other words, we only use simple, natural ingredients you\u2019d find in a grocery store and likely eat yourself, like free range beef, cassava root, and rosemary. Unlike most pet food, we slow cook our treats in small batches using time honored techniques like smoking and roasting to retain more of the food\u2019s nutritional value and flavor. It results in a far better product that we think your pup will appreciate. And if you\u2019re lucky, they\u2019ll share."], "product_details": ["Item Weight 1.38 pounds", "Manufacturer Full Moon", "ASIN B09MZDFLSV", "Item model number 97649", "Customer Reviews 4.7 4.7 out of 5 stars (5,964)", "Date First Available December 3, 2021", "Item Package Dimensions L x W x H 11.22 x 9.49 x 2.48 inches", "Item Weight 22 Ounces", "Brand Name Full Moon", "Target Audience Keyword Dogs, dogs", "Directions Pieces per Day by Dog Weight: 5-15lbs 1/2 - 1 treats; 15-30lbs 1 - 2 treats; 30-50lbs 2 - 3 treats; 50-75+lbs 3 - 4 treats", "Model Name Essential Beef Savory Sticks", "Color Beef", "Size 1.38 Pound (Pack of 1)", "Age Range Description All Life Stages", "Number of Items 1", "Manufacturer Full Moon", "Style Dog Treats", "Breed Recommendation All Breed Sizes", "Included Components One 22.0 ounce bag", "Specific Uses for Product Training", "Package Dimensions \u200f : \u200e 11.22 x 9.49 x 2.48 inches; 1.38 Pounds", "Item model number \u200f : \u200e 97649", "Date First Available \u200f : \u200e December 3, 2021", "Manufacturer \u200f : \u200e Full Moon", "ASIN \u200f : \u200e B09MZDFLSV", "Best Sellers Rank: #201 in Pet Supplies ( See Top 100 in Pet Supplies ) #50 in Dog Treat Cookies, Biscuits & Snacks", "#50 in Dog Treat Cookies, Biscuits & Snacks", "Customer Reviews: 4.7 4.7 out of 5 stars (5,964)"], "images": "{\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818dBAV+UWL._AC_SX569_.jpg\":[569,569],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818dBAV+UWL._AC_SX425_.jpg\":[425,425],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818dBAV+UWL._AC_SX466_.jpg\":[466,466],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818dBAV+UWL._AC_SX522_.jpg\":[522,522],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818dBAV+UWL._AC_SY450_.jpg\":[450,450],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818dBAV+UWL._AC_SX679_.jpg\":[679,679],\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/818dBAV+UWL._AC_SY355_.jpg\":[355,355]}", "rating": "4.7 out of 5 stars", "number_of_reviews": "(5,964)", "link_to_all_reviews": "/product-reviews/B09MZDFLSV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews", "source_url": "https://www.amazon.com/Full-Moon-Natural-Treats-Essential/dp/B09MZDFLSV"}
